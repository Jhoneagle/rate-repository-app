# Rate Repository App

Repository contains exercise solutions for the [part 10](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part10) of the [Full Stack Open 2020](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

To find my solutions for the earlier parts (part 0-9) for the Full Stack Open -course can be found [here](https://github.com/Jhoneagle/Full-stack-2020-open).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install the project dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the Expo app on your phone or in a browser to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

### `npm run android`

Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) for detailed setup).

### `npm run ios`

Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

### `npm run web`

Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app on a browser. 

### `npm run eject`

This will start the process of "ejecting" from Create React Native App's build scripts. You'll be asked a couple of questions about how you'd like to build your project.

Warning: Running eject is a permanent action (aside from whatever version control system you use). An ejected app will require you to have an [Xcode and/or Android Studio environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) set up.

### `npm run lint`

"Lint" your Code to enforce a uniform style and find errors.
